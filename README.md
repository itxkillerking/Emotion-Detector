# Emotion Detector
An AI-powered emotion detection system that analyzes text and identifies the dominant emotion using a pre-trained API model.
The system detects the following emotions:
-->Joy
-->Anger
-->Fear
-->Sadness
-->Disgust

## Project Overview:
This project sends user text to a pre-trained emotion detection API, processes the response, extracts emotion scores, and determines the most dominant emotion.
It is designed to be:
-->Simple
-->Beginner-friendly
-->Easy to integrate into other AI systems or chatbots

## How It Works:
-->User provides text input
-->Text is sent to the emotion detection API
-->API returns emotions with confidence scores
-->Response is converted from JSON to Python objects
-->Emotion scores are compared
-->The emotion with the highest score is selected as the dominant emotion
-->Final result is formatted and returned
## Emotion Detection Logic:
-->Uses a pre-trained emotion recognition model
-->Reads emotion scores from API response
-->Finds the highest score
-->Handles API errors gracefully

## Technologies Used:
-->Python
-->REST API
-->JSON
-->Pre-trained Emotion Detection Model

## to run:
-->python server.py
